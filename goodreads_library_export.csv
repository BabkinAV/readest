Story maybe a bit sluggish at the beginning but then gets full-steam in the last quarter so its just hard to put down. The characters are all  vivid and bright, the plot twists were  really hard to predict. This is barely a fantasy novel anymore but  rather a tell of realpolitik and war only set into an imaginary world. And of course famous one-liners and witty humour are all in place.  Five out of five, Joe Abercrombie as usual surpasses every expectation.Just can't wait yet another year for the wrap up.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But in the second half it  became evident that Brown managed to fool everyone and the finale is absolutely surprising. The book also has some deep insights on human overpopulation problem, bioengineering, evolution, and, of course,  some of author's favorite themes, like history and architecture – all in a guise of a fast-paced thriller. All in all, Inferno is much better reading than previous Robert Langdon novel, The Lost Symbol. Five out of  five on my scale, recommended for reading.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

You mean, eleven years old kids moving interstellar fleets, really? Or taking over the world by posting on web forums? Also the final plot twist was a little bit too obvious for me. Aside from all that, the novel is very well-written with deep complex characters and plethora of action. A truly sci-fi classic absolutely worth both its  Hugo and  Nebula awards .
