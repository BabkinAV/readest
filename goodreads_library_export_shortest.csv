Story maybe a bit sluggish at the beginning but then gets full-steam in the last quarter so its just hard to put down. The characters are all  vivid and bright, the plot twists were  really hard to predict. This is barely a fantasy novel anymore but  rather a tell of realpolitik and war only set into an imaginary world. And of course famous one-liners and witty humour are all in place.  Five out of five, Joe Abercrombie as usual surpasses every expectation.Just can't wait yet another year for the wrap up.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
